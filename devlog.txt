Total: 14h

ToDo: 
- make arithmetic unit (adder/subtractor, inc, dec, multiplier)
    like LU, data inputs and output selector for each device within
- make ALU:
    ALU has one output enable for each device within  
    Control unit converts multi-bit to single wire signal
    Passthrough for comparator flags from adder/subtractor
- Control Unit
    decoder receives opcode from PM and sends it to ALU
    add PC and incrementer (needs an adder)
    PC has to be a register, that connects to PM select (2*numbits)
    also has RAMPage select register (2-bytes: store AB->rampage)
- make CPU (ALU+CU):
    put comparator flags and PC register in cpu
    add stack pointer and function return
- make GUI for front plate with lights and switches
    program mode/run mode switch
    pulse/auto-run switch
    addr select
    OP code
    C, A, B
    write button
    pulse button
- make automated testing for all parts and components
help me make an automated testing suite that will test all my classes. use the standard industry format inside the testing folder (retain the files currently in that folder)
- make 3-bit computer with screen. 
- make 3-bit pong and snake
- generate base minecraft 4-bit pc (with multiplier, read-only divider subroutine)
- make a faceplate GUI
- make faceplate addon to see RAM
- make graphics controllers with char mode :
    - knows to take 3-5 instructions depending on version
    - OR (better) direclty wired to last 4 addresses in RAM ([mode/rgb],[rgb2],[Rpage],[Rsel],[Cpage],[Csel])
      and activate with "write to graphics" command. this allows for 64 colors.
    - 64x64 Color screen: 4 op codes [mode, R, G, B] [RS1-2, CS1-2] [RS3-6] [CS3-6]
    - 128x128 BW screen: 4 op codes [mode, RS0, CS0, data] [RS1-2, CS1-2] [RS3-6] [CS3-6] = 18x25 chars
    - 256x256 
- make 5-bit version with grahics
- make function call and return and pointers (store addr in ram registers and dereference)
- make 8-bit version with Operating System and graphcis
- make 16-bit version with OS and graphcis
- try architecture with all in RAM (and storage) and no program memory
