Total: 14h

ToDo: 
- make decoder 
== this completes devices ==
- make program memory (4-bit minecraft)
- make main memory (registers for RAM) with imbedded controller
- make arithmetic unit (adder/subtractor, multiplier, divider)
- make ALU:
    ALU has one output enable for each device within (also calls evaluate only on that device component) 
    Control unit converts multi-bit to single wire signal
    Passthrough for comparator flags from adder/subtractor
- make CPU (ALU+CU):
    put comparator flags in cpu
    add the registers like on a pc
- make GUI for front plate with lights and switches
    program mode/run mode switch
    pulse/auto-run switch
    addr select
    OP code
    C, A, B
    write button
    pulse button
- generate minecraft 4-bit pc
- make a programmer to load machine code to it
- make graphcis controller
- make 5-bit version with grahics
- make function call and return and pointers (store addr in ram registers and dereference)
- make 8-bit version with Operating System and graphcis
- make 16-bit version with OS and graphcis
- try architecture with all in RAM (and storage) and no program memory

Feb 1 2026 : 
1.5h comparator
1h logic unit
2h multiplier
.5h divider
1h decoder

Jan 31 2026 : 3h - total: 17h
.5h multi-input XOR
.5h all-component tester utility, testing all components after the changes
