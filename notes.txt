Minecraft 4-bit ISA:
(here A, B and C are not registers but respective section of program memory)
(the addresses in A, B and C are RAM addresses, so it'll have PM and RAM, both size 16)
0000 halt
0001 store litA->C (save literal in 3rd nibble of PM to addr in 2nd nibble of PM)
0010 A+B->C
0011 A+litB->C
0100 A+B->C
0101 A+litB->C
0110 A==B Goto C
0111 A==B litGoto C
1000 A>B Goto C
1001 A>B litGoto C
1010 A<B Goto C
1011 A<B litGoto C
1100 A*B->C
1101 A*litB->C
1110 >>
1111 <<

5-bit:
dereference pointer (store addrA->C)
write to graphics line
write to graphics block
write to graphics data

Binary Instructions (4-bit):
0000 halt
0001 add
0010 subtract
0011 multiply
0100 mov_lit
0101 mov_mem
0110 >>
0111 <<
1000 >
1001 <
1010 =
1011 >>
1100 <<
1101 &&
1110 ||
1111 !


Binary Instructions:
00000 no-op
00001 mov_mem (to register or addr)
00010 mov_lit (to register or addr) 
00011 store (register to register or addr) (so jump if store to PC)
00100 Unsigned add
00101 Unsigned subtract
00110 Unsigned compare ?
00111 Unsigned multiply
01000 Signed add
01001 Signed subtract
01010 Signed compare ?
01011 Signed multiply
01100 > ?
01101 < ?
01110 == ?
01111 >>
10000 <<
10001 &&
10010 ||
10011 !
10100 XOR
100000 store to Graphics driver line (addr, data)
100001 store to Graphics driver block (in last line)
100001 store to Graphics driver data (in last block)

Registers:
A
B
C
PC (program counter)
SP (stack pointer)
ZF (zero flag, show A==B) (8-bit NOR)
SF (sign flag, shows A-B<0 => A<B)
OF (overflow flag, show 

Comparator:
Z (Zero Flag / ZF): Set if result == 0. Used for EQ checks.
N (Negative Flag / SF - Sign Flag): Set if MSB of result is 1 (negative in signed). Used for LT/GT signed.
C (Carry Flag / CF): Set if carry out from add, or no-borrow from subtract. Used for unsigned LT/GT.
V (Overflow Flag / OF): Set if signed overflow occurred (carry into MSB ≠ carry out of MSB). Used with N for signed comparisons.
With all four:
EQ: Z
LT (signed): N XOR V
GT (signed): ¬(N XOR V) ∧ ¬Z
LT (unsigned): C
GT (unsigned): ¬C ∧ ¬Z

Multipliers:
Multiplier is one cycle
sequential mult and div are multi-cycle and use busy flag

Assembly	        Logic	    What it checks in the Flags Register
JE (Jump Equal)	      ==	            Is ZF = 1?
JNE (Jump Not Equal)  !=	            Is ZF = 0?
JL (Jump Less)	      < 	            Does SF != OF?
JG (Jump Greater)	  >	                Is ZF = 0 and SF = OF?
